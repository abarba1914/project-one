### PROJECT DESCRIPTION/OUTLINE:
This project will focus on vaccination rates for each of Chicago's zip codes as they compare to income per capita. 
The data sets we plan to use include:

1. City of Chicago COVID-19 Vaccine Doses by Zip Code https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Vaccine-Doses-by-ZIP-Code-At-Least-One-Do/c28u-q29v
    - analyze number of people in each zip code who have recieved at least one dose
    - percentage of people in each zip code who have received at least one dose
    - create a bar graph that compares percentages of people vaccinated by zip code
    - choropleth map of percentage of people vaccinated by zip code


2. US Census Bureau API # Run Census Search to retrieve data on all zip codes (2013 ACS5 Census)
https://github.com/CommerceDataService/census-wrapper for library documentation
https://gist.github.com/afhaque/60558290d6efd892351c4b64e5c01e9b for labels
    - Average household income for each Chicago zip code
    - choropleth map of average household income

### Questions we want to answer

    - Is there a correlation between income per capita and percentage of population who have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine?

    - What is the income per capita for each zip code?
    
    - Do certain zip codes have a higher percentage of their population vaccinated?
